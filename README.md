# ECONIndexer_API
Repository used to store and manipulate some Brazilian Economic Indexers, such as IPCA, CDI, SELIC, etc.

The main purpose of this repository is improving my skills with Python and Streamlit. Also, I am starting with MongoDB.

For now, we have 2 main scripts:
 - admin_app: used to register the Economic Indexers values in MongoDB
 - user_app: used to display a full table related to each Economic Indexer, in order to perform some calculation and analyse some charts
